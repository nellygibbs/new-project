<!-- Respect the Game -->

'Respect the Game' is an app that will show you all NBA scores! My inspiration for this game came from my love of the game. As a kid, I played basketball since this age of 9 and I ALWAYS watched basketball with my father. It was our special bonding time. As I grew older, responsibilities piled on and I find myself too busy to catch most games. This is where 'Respect the Game' comes into play. It will allow any user to pick a date via the calendar and be able to see all the games that took place that day. It will show you the visiting team, the home team and both scores. Now you and I won't need to scroll on ESPN for forever, or wait until Sports Center airs. We can come to this app and get a quick snapshot of the game scores from a certain day.

1. once the page loads, please click on a desired date and your results will follow!

<!-- future enhancements -->

I would like to add a couple of features into the app:

1. having a link under the scoreboard that will show highlight videos from the game
2. maybe also have the names of the teams inside of the scoreboards be clickable so that the user can go to their team's page and be able to get all information about their team
3. For the NBA games that'll show in the future, maybe I can add in a game where the user can go to guess who they think will win.
4. Find a better background for the app to make it look more appealing
